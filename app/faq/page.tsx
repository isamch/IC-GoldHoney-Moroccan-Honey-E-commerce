          question: "Is your honey 100% natural and pure?",
          answer:
            "Yes, absolutely! All our honey is 100% natural, pure, and unprocessed. We source directly from traditional Moroccan beekeepers who use sustainable practices. Our honey contains no artificial additives, preservatives, or sweeteners.",
        },
        {
          question: "What makes Moroccan honey special?",
          answer:
            "Moroccan honey is unique due to the diverse flora of the Atlas Mountains and the traditional beekeeping methods passed down through generations. The varied landscape produces honey with complex flavor profiles that you won't find anywhere else in the world. IC GoldHoney brings you this authentic experience.",
        },
        {
          question: "How should I store my honey?",
          answer:
            "Store your honey in a cool, dry place at room temperature. Avoid refrigeration as it can cause crystallization. Properly stored honey has an indefinite shelf life. If crystallization occurs, gently warm the jar in warm water to return it to liquid form.",
        },
        {
          question: "What are the health benefits of your honey?",
          answer:
            "Our natural honey contains antioxidants, enzymes, and minerals. Different varieties offer specific benefits: eucalyptus honey has antiseptic properties, thyme honey supports respiratory health, and all our honey varieties can help with seasonal allergies when consumed regularly.",

      questions: [
        {
          question: "Do you offer international shipping?",
          answer:
            "Yes, we ship worldwide! Shipping costs and delivery times vary by location. We offer free shipping on orders over $50 within the US, Canada, and Europe. For other regions, shipping costs are calculated at checkout.",
        },
        {
          question: "How long does shipping take?",
          answer:
            "Domestic orders (US) typically arrive within 3-5 business days. International orders take 7-14 business days depending on the destination. We provide tracking information for all orders.",
        },
        {
          question: "How is the honey packaged for shipping?",
          answer:
            "We use protective packaging to ensure your honey arrives safely. Each jar is wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a sturdy box with additional padding. We've never had a jar break during shipping!",
        },
        {
          question: "Can I track my order?",
          answer:
            "Yes! Once your order ships, you'll receive a tracking number via email. You can use this to monitor your package's progress until it reaches your door.",

        },
        {
          question: "Do you have organic certification?",
          answer:
            "While our honey is produced using organic practices, formal organic certification is complex in Morocco. However, our beekeepers follow traditional, chemical-free methods, and our honey is tested to ensure it meets the highest purity standards.",
        },
        {
          question: "What if I'm not satisfied with my purchase?",
          answer:
            "We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely happy with your honey, contact us for a full refund or exchange. Your satisfaction is our top priority.",

        {
          question: "Which honey variety should I choose?",
          answer:
            "It depends on your taste preferences! Wildflower honey is great for beginners with its balanced flavor. Eucalyptus is refreshing and medicinal. Argan blossom is rare and nutty. Orange blossom is bright and citrusy. We recommend trying our variety pack!",
        },
        {
          question: "How much honey should I consume daily?",
          answer:
            "A tablespoon (21g) per day is a good amount for most adults to enjoy the health benefits. You can have it straight, in tea, on toast, or mixed into yogurt. Always consult your healthcare provider if you have specific health concerns.",
